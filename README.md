## Introduction
The Team 4 application tools will help users make simple decisions or calculations. Such as a BMI calculator, a retirement savings goal, shortest distance calculator, an email verifier, and splitting a dinner tab calulator. The application will be using the JavaScript language and Jest for testing.

## How To Get Started
1. cd into a chosen directory and run `git clone https://github.com/drbyron-github-classroom/ppa-1-sw-testing-qa-spring-2018-official-team-4.git `
2. Run `cd ppa-1-sw-testing-qa-spring-2018-official-team-4`
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. To start the application run `node app.js`
5. To test the application, run `npm test`
6. To make the testing framework watch changes, run `npm test -- --watchAll`

## Testing Coverage
1. Run `npm test` to generate a coverage folder
2. To see output, run in command line or open lcov-report/index.html in a web browser

## Programming Language
We will be programming in JavaScript

## Testing Framework
We are using Jest as our testing framework. It contains a test runner and an assertion library.
